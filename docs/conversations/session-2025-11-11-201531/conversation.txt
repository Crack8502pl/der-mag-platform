[2025-11-11 20:17:35] USER: Problem Statement

You are working on an issue in the 'Crack8502pl/der-mag-platform' repository.

Create a pull request that adds the complete transcript of the current chat session into the repository under docs/conversations/session-2025-11-11-201531/. The PR should include three files:

1) docs/conversations/session-2025-11-11-201531/README.md
- A short human-readable summary of the session (date/time, user, purpose).
- A list of the files added and how to view them.

2) docs/conversations/session-2025-11-11-201531/conversation.txt
- Plain text file containing the full raw transcript of the session, with timestamps where available and speaker tags (User, Assistant, System, Developer, Tool outputs). Preserve the order and content exactly as in the chat.

3) docs/conversations/session-2025-11-11-201531/conversation.md
- Markdown version of the transcript with headings, code blocks (where code was posted), and links to any repository files referenced in the conversation. Keep the transcript faithful but format code blocks using triple backticks. Include a table of contents at the top linking to major sections (e.g., Diagnostics, Fixes, Files changed, Final state).

Requirements for the PR:
- Create a new branch named chore/add-session-transcript-2025-11-11-201531.
- Add the three files above with the exact content described.
- Ensure files use UTF-8 encoding and LF line endings.
- Commit message: "chore: add session conversation transcript (2025-11-11 20:15:31)".
- PR title: "chore: add session conversation transcript (2025-11-11 20:15:31)" and PR body that summarizes what was added and why, and includes a short note about potential sensitive data (remind to redact secrets if necessary).

Notes for the coding agent creating the PR:
- Use the full conversation available in the current chat session. Include system, developer, and assistant messages as part of the transcript.
- When the chat referenced specific repository files (e.g., backend/src/app.ts, backend/public/api-tester.html), add links to those files in conversation.md pointing to their paths in the repository (relative links).
- Do NOT include any real secrets in the committed files. If any secrets (like passwords) appear in the transcript, redact them by replacing with "[REDACTED]" and mention what was redacted in README.md.
- After creating the branch, commit and open a PR targeting the repository default branch (main).

Create the PR and return its URL in the agent output.

[2025-11-11 20:17:36] ASSISTANT: Analysis

Now let me check the current branch and understand what's expected.

Let me check what the default branch is and create the correct branch.

[2025-11-11 20:17:37] TOOL: bash (Check default branch)
Command: cd /home/runner/work/der-mag-platform/der-mag-platform && git remote show origin | grep "HEAD branch"

Output:
HEAD branch: main

[2025-11-11 20:17:37] ASSISTANT: Good, the default branch is `main`. Now let me create the new branch as specified.

[2025-11-11 20:17:37] TOOL: bash (Create new branch as specified)
Command: cd /home/runner/work/der-mag-platform/der-mag-platform && git checkout -b chore/add-session-transcript-2025-11-11-201531

Output:
Switched to a new branch 'chore/add-session-transcript-2025-11-11-201531'
